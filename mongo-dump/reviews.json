The live-action films of 1996 and 2000 are stored somewhere in my memory, even though I never really sat down and watched the movies all by myself. Cruella might just be another live-action film from the Mickey Mouse studio, but it's far from being yet another remake, much on the contrary. Just like the vast majority of the company's villains, Cruella de Vil (portrayed by Glenn Close in the previous installments) was even worse than the generic antagonist with cliche motivations that eventually every studio used and reused to exhaustion.\r\n\r\nBesides Cruella's greedy necessities, purely evil personality, and extreme vanity, this wicked character was driven by something completely unthinkable: skinning short-haired puppies to have more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur. Anyone with a conscience knows that Disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes, especially regarding this motivation in particular. How would a movie with a dog-killing protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful? Obviously, this hardcore motif no longer belongs to Emma Stone's Cruella's defining character traits, which might be a no-no for those viewers who are more protective of the original material, as if times and culture didn't change from decade to decade.\r\n\r\nSince the start of Disney's live-action remakes campaign, audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films. Some wish for a copy-paste version of the same story, while others desire a completely different take on the well-known narrative. However, the best experience - and the primary goal of these movies - is a mix of both: a version that keeps the essence and the message of the original while bringing something new and different to the table to justify its existence. Cruella isn't a remake but an origin(al) story based on a classic villain... And it's undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen this year until this day! I didn't expect to write an extensive review, but with so much to address, I know my thoughts will take a while to transcribe to this article.\r\n\r\nLet me start with some easy elements that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into \"deep analysis mode\". The costume design is indisputably the technical standout. The colorfully stunning dresses steal the show visually, but it's how it differentiates Estella and Cruella that Jenny Beavan shines in her job. Just from what Stone wears, the viewers can easily decipher what character she's playing. The differences between the glamorous, rich people that the Baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty, poor friends Estella meets at the beginning of the movie - Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) - is also accentuated through their wardrobes.\r\n\r\nThe extravagant parties are packed with Oscar-worthy costumes, but also with beautiful makeup & hair (Nadia Stacey) and absolutely ravishing production design (Fiona Crombie). Nicholas Britell's score carries little references to the music of the other installments, as does the film itself. Craig Gillespie doesn't hide the Easter Eggs spread throughout the runtime, of which some will definitely please the most avid fans. Technically, it's as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio, but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above. In a movie where even the black-and-white hair and clothes of Cruella pop off the screen, the CGI backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyper-realistic remake of The Lion King.\r\n\r\nCGI dogs are employed during most of the runtime, which is not only understandable but also commendable. Animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago. However, the VFX don't look good enough, causing the dogs - mainly the Dalmatians - to be an unintended distraction. In addition to this, a specific outdoor location that's quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark, fake background that just feels way too off. Finally, the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible CGI that will definitely leave the more \"logic-driven\" viewers stunned with disappointment. I consider this a nitpick, especially since it's not a film without silliness.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Cruella's success partially rests on Gillespie's tone balance. Jasper and Horace become the comic-relief characters, starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from. Now, some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun. However, Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's screenplay carries undeniable similarities to The Devil Wears Prada and the most recent Joker. Estella's life story is far from being a happy tale, and Cruella's rise even less. Overall, the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic, depressing, traumatic storyline is mostly well-handled, but there are a few moments where Gillespie lets it too loose, especially in the over-Disney-ish last fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nSo, let's address the two protagonists: Estella and Cruella. The comparisons with Joaquin Phoenix's take on Arthur Fleck / Joker are impossible to unsee. From the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation, Emma Stone's character follows a similar arc, but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems. Estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the self-centered, self-indulgent Baroness, which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business. The Baroness' despicable treatment of Estella brings the ruthless Cruella gradually back to life, eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little Estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living... without having to carry on extreme measures.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected, clever twist pretty much completes the protagonist's transformation, which genuinely caught me by surprise. I admit that I didn't have high hopes for this origin story. Nevertheless, the well-written screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain, offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations. While it's true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous Baroness, Cruella never truly becomes 100% that person. Honestly, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, but I don't think there's room for another film that wouldn't hurt the one we just got. So, there's just one more aspect to delve into: the cast's performances.\r\n\r\nJoel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves. Both share a compelling connection to Estella, one that I believe deserved a better conclusion. They become a family, living and stealing throughout their lives, but when Estella starts giving Cruella some screentime, a few issues arise within the trio. These problems are indeed approached and solved, but in a less dramatic manner than I hoped for. Fry is excellent as the more competent, rational Jasper, but Hauser never stops being extremely funny. The before-mentioned balance is rarely affected by the characters' comedic banter, which is something the actors also deserve credit for.\r\n\r\nEmma Thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography, interpreting the Baroness von Hellman. How can you make an extremely over-the-top character feel cartoonish yet strangely real? Someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world? Thompson takes her role, and the only reason why she doesn't steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other Emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain. With obvious references to Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, Thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene, making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Emma Stone manages to stay a level above everyone else. I firmly believe that she's one of the best actresses of her generation. Carrying one of the most expressive faces in Hollywood, Stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities. Without looking at the screen, any viewer will be able to know if she's talking as Estella or Cruella. Not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character, but the mannerisms alter as well. It would be a massive surprise if such an early Disney performance got an Oscar nomination, so her chances are obviously thin. However, if there was an award for Best Monologue, Stone would be a strong contender.\r\n\r\nI don't recall how many minutes it really is, but I can't forget that long, uncut take with Stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue. Switching between Estella and Cruella in the span of milliseconds, her micro-expressions elevate a heartfelt, character-defining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema. Stone gives not one but two impressive, attention-grabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a Cruella they can understand and even root for.\r\n\r\nCruella is not only one of 2021's biggest surprises, but it's also one of the best movies of the year so far. Despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative, Craig Gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin(al) story about one of Disney's classic villains. Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the Estella-Cruella transformation, giving her non-dog-killing, emotionally compelling motivations, a traumatic, depressing past, and an unexpected twist that will probably catch most viewers off-guard. With one of her best performances ever, Emma Stone delivers an award-worthy display, interpreting two personalities in impressive fashion, stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations. Technically, the distracting CGI in animals and some noticeable green-screen don't overcome the predictably Oscar-winning, stunning costume design, as well as the gorgeous makeup & hair, wonderful production design, and sweet score packed with excellent song choices. A character study that makes this one of Disney's best live-action films in the last couple of decades.\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "created_at": "2021-05-26T15:07:13.281Z", "id": "60ae64210f2ae10057563b35", "updated_at": "2021-05-26T15:07:13.281Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60ae64210f2ae10057563b35"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}, {"id": 632357, "page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 0, "total_results": 0}, {"id": 503736, "page": 1, "results": [{"author": "msbreviews", "author_details": {"name": "", "username": "msbreviews", "avatar_path": "/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg", "rating": 6.0}, "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nZack Snyder is far from being a consensual director. Some viewers really love his work - Zack Snyder's Justice League was only possible due to passionate, hardcore fans - while others fail to understand the reasons behind the constant hype surrounding the filmmaker's projects. Personally, despite not belonging to his enormous fandom, I quite enjoy his work outside of the DCEU. From Dawn of the Dead to Watchmen, passing through 300, I hold these films in high regard. However, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is unquestionably one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of my life, and it's arguably the movie that triggered the beginning of the controversial general opinion about the director.\r\n\r\nUsually, when people find themselves on a rough path, going back to their roots helps them get back on track, which is precisely what Snyder does here. The \"zombie apocalypse\" genre has been around for decades, but since the start of the new century, audiences all over the world were able to witness a narrative that was once unique and exciting become one of the most overdone, generic, formulaic pieces of storytelling. This last statement doesn't mean a few gems can't come out of it. From probably the greatest zombie film ever, Train to Busan, to the comedy classic Zombieland, there are truly great movies within the genre. So, where does Army of the Dead stand?\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the middle, labeled as \"good fun\", which is all I expected from this Netflix film. Let me get one thing out of the way immediately: this looks, sounds, and feels like a Snyder movie. Countless over-stylized shots, long slow-motion scenes, an overwhelming amount of gore and blood, bizarre song choices, a two-hour-and-a-half runtime... for better or worst, no one can complain about studio interferences this time. Clearly, the famous director had complete creative freedom, and it shows through all of the film's positives and negatives. Fortunately, Snyder's filmmaking style not only fits well within this genre, but it also works for the simple, entertainment-driven screenplay.\r\n\r\nA vast majority of viewers will press play in the hopes of receiving an action-heavy, fun, uncomplicated zombie movie with all the attributes that these flesh-eating characters possess. Except for a genuinely interesting storyline - though not new - concerning a specific type of zombies, everything else is pretty much what viewers have seen for the past two decades, which might be disappointing yet still highly enjoyable. From the way people can kill them to the time each infected person takes to become a zombie, every single cliche is present in this film. Honestly, none of them really annoy me unless they're repeated to exhaustion, which I don't believe Army of the Dead does that much.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences are all well-shot, but I did expect more from them. Most scenes are just characters randomly shooting, hitting insane headshots that viewers will just have to accept as something normal, which shouldn't be too hard, considering the recent action flicks. Occasionally, one-on-one or one-on-many combats ensue, and it elevates the excitement levels by focusing on that single character, but then it's brought down again by tiresome shootouts. Snyder asks the viewers to accept several dumb plot and character decisions, so it's always going to be a matter of how much you can take until it starts getting too much...\r\n\r\nPersonally, these logical issues don't really bother me - the ridiculous third act does push my limits, I admit. However, the lack of character development and overall care for everyone in the movie will always be a massive problem, especially when supposedly emotional, heartfelt moments end up having zero impact. I doubt anyone will be surprised to find out that people die in this film besides the zombies, consequently bringing tonal balance to the table. Obviously, not every character needs to receive a deep backstory and complex motivations, but it doesn't hurt to tell the viewers a bit about the people going into the danger zone so that the action sequences can carry more tension.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, there's a period in the movie where a deadly countdown begins, and everything that occurs from the starting time to the climactic moment just feels like any other scene in the film. The lack of tension and sense of urgency ultimately stops it from being one of the greats. Overall, it's an enjoyable zombie flick that offered me a blast of fun, but I still believe it could have been a lot better. Dave Bautista (My Spy, Avengers: Endgame) is the absolute standout, interpreting the only fully-developed character of the movie. Ella Purnell (Wildlike), Omari Hardwick (Sorry to Bother You), and Nora Arnezeder (Origin) are also quite good.\r\n\r\nFinally, a point must be made about the relationship between studios and filmmakers. While I'm all in favor of creative freedom, there must always be a compromise between both parties. Snyder didn't gain fame for badly editing his films for no reason. Army of the Dead is, like most of his movies, unnecessarily long. The \"deleted scenes\" feature on Blu-rays doesn't exist for show-off. There's no film in the history of cinema where every single second recorded is pure gold, and runtimes are something studios can *help* filmmakers nail perfectly. In the end, I still consider this movie to move quickly through its straightforward story, so the excess screentime might not be that big of an issue for other viewers.\r\n\r\nArmy of the Dead brings Zack Snyder back to the zombie apocalypse genre, delivering an entertaining, action-driven story that will please most spectators. With his distinct, divisive filmmaking style completely unrestrained, for better or worst, the standout Dave Bautista and his team fight through the cliches, lack of character development, and excessive runtime to still offer plenty of excitement. The lack of tension and urgency hurt some of the last action sequences, but all are well-shot and packed with energy. Exceptional production design and VFX aren't enough to compensate for the predictably formulaic screenplay, especially when the only interesting zombie storyline is only partially explored. Overall, it's the definition of \"good fun\", so if your weekend has a two-and-a-half-hour empty slot, Netflix has my endorsement.\r\n\r\nRating: B-", "created_at": "2021-05-22T22:34:23.079Z", "id": "60a986ef7f4f21002a909c9f", "updated_at": "2021-05-22T22:34:23.079Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60a986ef7f4f21002a909c9f"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}, {"id": 637649, "page": 1, "results": [{"author": "msbreviews", "author_details": {"name": "", "username": "msbreviews", "avatar_path": "/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg", "rating": 7.0}, "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nSome people really don't appreciate Guy Ritchie's style. His trademark fast-forward, HFR (high frame rate) type of action doesn't appeal to many viewers, and his nonlinear narrative structure is often more confusing than captivating. At least, these are the common complaints across his filmography. While I acknowledge that these attributes don't always work, I'm actually quite a fan of his filmmaking techniques. From his more recent work on Aladdin and The Gentlemen to his take on classic characters such as Sherlock Holmes and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, I genuinely enjoy Ritchie's risky, divisive approach on the best way to tell a story.\r\n\r\nGoing in completely blind to Wrath of Man, I honestly didn't have a good feeling. I expected a generic, hollow, forgettable action flick with a main actor who everyone has seen countless times in this genre. I just hoped it would be entertaining enough for me to have a decent couple of hours in front of the TV. Well, this movie might be 2021's best surprise to date! If Zack Snyder (Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League) is often criticized for his excessive use of slow-motion, Ritchie receives the exact same complaints but regarding his high-speed action scenes. This time, the latter leaves his well-known characteristics aside and proves that he's not a one-trick filmmaker.\r\n\r\nImpressively long, uncut takes - some reach the three-minute mark - help create a tremendously tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime. Every scene is set up with patience and precise timing, making every single tiny movement from the camera and actors capture the audience's attention. Christopher Benstead's score is one of those examples that I will start giving people when they ask about impactful music in film. The heavy cello notes are incredibly ominous, establishing the mood of the whole environment in a way that will leave no viewer indifferent. Some of you might read the following as a critique, but the build-ups for each action scene steal the spotlight from the latter.\r\n\r\nWith that said, the shootouts and overall action are entertaining and well-filmed, which I believe will please a vast majority of spectators. Jason Statham (The Meg, Hobbs & Shaw) delivers a one-dimensional performance that would feel disappointing in any other movie, but it works for this protagonist. The main character is supposed to be mysterious and capable of anything, so it's only logical that he hides every ounce of emotion - even though it negatively affects a couple of dialogues. Furthermore, it's Jason Statham\u2026 moviegoers go see his films for his action skills, not his acting chops. When it comes to fire a gun or beat someone up, there are not that many actors who can do so as convincing as him.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, Ritchie didn't let go of his favorite narrative structure. Nonlinear storytelling is extremely difficult to pull off perfectly due to how easily it becomes confusing or messy. Fortunately, Wrath of Man features several storylines converging all in a single moment, which quickly demonstrates what the screenwriters plan to do. A mysteriously compelling first half transitions to a more predictable, formulaic second part where one of the storylines feels both tacked on and uninteresting. The secondary characters lack any sort of arc or random development, with the focus going completely into the protagonist's mission, whatever that may be.\r\n\r\nWrath of Man isn't a groundbreaking, mind-blowing, or even innovative action movie, but it's still one of the biggest, best surprises of the year. While it's true that Guy Ritchie still follows the genre formulas of success, he shocks everyone by leaving his trademark filmmaking techniques aside, delivering an incredibly tense film packed with suspenseful, one-take build-ups to energetic, riveting action sequences. Jason Statham's one-dimensional display works well enough for a mysteriously captivating protagonist who the viewers can easily root for once his true goal is revealed. Christopher Benstead's score tremendously elevates the entire movie, establishing an extremely gripping atmosphere. The nonlinear storytelling features parallel narratives that are not all interesting or necessary, ending with an ironically abrupt last scene, contradicting the overall steady pacing. In the end, it's a solid recommendation to watch in theaters if possible.\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "created_at": "2021-05-06T21:57:02.367Z", "id": "6094662e9f0e19007a5c4ce1", "updated_at": "2021-05-06T21:57:02.367Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6094662e9f0e19007a5c4ce1"}, {"author": "Peter M", "author_details": {"name": "Peter M", "username": "narrator56", "avatar_path": "/tVbrLJzA2RwRlE7dJLJG54UsAkq.jpg", "rating": null}, "content": "Viewers who like action films with plenty of violence for the sake of having violence will love this movie.

While the first film in 1995 was a decent hit; the follow-up in 1997 disappointed fans who had grown weary of the PG-13 take on the series.\r\n\r\nSubsequent efforts such as the 2011 television series also left fans wanting more; especially since the game series had become even more graphic and violent.\r\n\r\nAn animated film released in 2020 gave fans a taste of what they wanted as it featured graphical violence which many fans believed was essential to properly catch the spirit and action of the series.\r\n\r\nThe latest offering in the series \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d; reboots the cinematic universe and gives fans the intense, brutal, and graphic violence that they have demanded. The film keeps the basic premise that the Outworld realm has won nine tournaments in a row, and based on the ancient laws; one more victory would allow them to take control of the Earth.\r\n\r\nRaiden the Thunder God (Tadanobu Asano); who has been tasked with protecting Earth looks to assemble and train a band of champions to save Earth.

The action sequences are well-choreographed and there were some great recreations of classic moves by characters from the game series which were really well utilized and did not seem like gratuitous pandering.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot is fairly simplistic and does not deviate greatly from the source material; it does give a larger backstory to the universe. It was really enjoyable to see many nods to the franchise throughout both subtle and overt and while some characters were glaringly absent which was a surprise; the characters that were included were really solid to see and the door was wide open for their inclusion at a later date.\r\n\r\nWhile the cast does not contain any star power in terms of what Western audiences might expect from a major studio release; the ensemble works well and do a great job in bringing their characters to life.\r\n\r\nThe film leaves sequels wide open and teases a character that in my opinion was a glaring omission from the film.

Besides occasional visits to my neighbor's house to play several games on his PlayStation 1 (or 2?), I've only played this game on the nostalgic arcade machines that gave me incredible joy when I was younger. In all honesty, I don't exactly remember if I watched the previous film adaptations of the popular franchise, but I do know that both didn't receive the best feedback from critics and audiences, especially the 1997's flick. Therefore, I went to the theater - first time in over four months - with no real expectations. I just hoped the action would compensate for the predictably flawed screenplay.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm surprised at how much I actually had fun with this movie. Considering this is Simon McQuoid's feature directorial debut, as well as Greg Russo's first screenplay credit, my hopes rested on Dave Callaham's previous works (Wonder Woman 1984, Zombieland: Double Tap) and on the gory, violent action sequences. The latter component is the best element in the entire film, which will definitely leave the viewers in search of action-heavy entertainment satisfied. The opening sequence shows the merciless brutality of each fight through phenomenal stunt work (Hiroyuki Sanada is impressively talented), long takes with exceptional choreography, and a shocking amount of blood - something quite characteristic of the game franchise.\r\n\r\nThe only negative aspect about this opening is the fact that no other action scene surpasses it, which doesn't mean that the rest of the battles fail to live up to the expectations of the most avid fans. Despite a few shaky, roughly edited scenes, the vast majority of the fights are easy to follow and feature jaw-dropping moments, such as the \"Fatality!\" finishing moves. McQuoid and his team of writers try to make the movie understandable and exciting to everyone, but if there's a chance of placing a reference, an Easter Egg, or something alike, they proudly and unrestrainedly present it to the audience, which will trigger the most hardcore fans to let go of a resounding, adrenaline-fueled \"YEAH!\".\r\n\r\nI admit that I didn't expect the film to deliver those epic announcements from the game. From \"Flawless Victory!\" to \"Fatality!\", without forgetting the classic \"Fight!\", I did smile during these moments, where the actors actually change the tone of their voice to mimic the famous one-liners. Is it extraordinarily cheesy and over-the-top? Of course. Would any fan want it any other way? It might be a tad too much for some viewers, but I have to compliment McQuoid for fully committing to this adaptation. There's no ounce of shame, regret, or restraint. It's a movie made with a passionate public in mind, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to every single fan of the games.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe people will end up liking or disliking this film based on how much the action compensates for the lack of a compelling story, which is something even the most enthusiastic fans are probably anticipating as well. From a couple of nonsensical narrative decisions to hollow, uninteresting characters, the screenplay is solely focused on explaining everything surrounding Mortal Kombat - Earthworld, Outworld, champions, stakes, rules of the tournament - through lazy yet admittedly efficient exposition scenes. The characters could have been better developed, and the actors are far from being completely convincing. However, no one will enter the theater or click \"play\" on HBO Max expecting to witness an Oscar-worthy story...\r\n\r\nMortal Kombat is a surprisingly decent adaptation of the popular franchise, which will leave the most hardcore fans quite satisfied. For viewers with no experience or knowledge about the games, it could be a tough watch. However, if all the audience seeks is action-heavy entertainment, then Simon McQuoid's directorial debut fulfills the more reasonable expectations. Packed with references that even the least avid gamers will recognize, the fighting scenes are mostly well-filmed and quite energetic, focusing more on the gruesome, bloody, jaw-dropping Fatalities. Despite the opening sequence being the peak of great action, there are a couple of moments that could be compared to some parts of that epic start. Story-wise, Greg Russo and Dave Callaham's screenplay is as flawed as expected, possessing ridiculous developments and an abundance of dull exposition scenes, but it's the underwhelming use of a few interesting characters that negatively impacts the movie the most. In the end, I definitely recommend it to fans of the franchise, who will surely appreciate this film a lot more than myself.\r\n\r\nRating: B-", "created_at": "2021-04-24T20:23:48.438Z", "id": "60847e545c3247007764906c", "updated_at": "2021-04-24T20:23:48.438Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60847e545c3247007764906c"}, {"author": "sykobanana", "author_details": {"name": "", "username": "sykobanana", "avatar_path": "/j2KpvD880J95lqf3ct4u1MmWZhE.jpg", "rating": 7.0}, "content": "I liked this more than I should have.  \r\n\r\nI have tried the games, but am not into the fighting genre of games (although the Injustice series grabbed me for its story).

While the original trilogy with Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford is fondly remembered by most people, including myself, the XXI century\u2019s reboots with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were nothing but failed attempts at reviving a movie franchise. John Krasinski\u2019s TV show was apparently successful, but unfortunately, I didn\u2019t watch it. So, why not a spin-off? Michael B. Jordan comes in for a supposedly two-part film series with John Kelly - famously known as John Clark - as the main character. Stefano Sollima rejoins forces with Taylor Sheridan - both worked on Sicario: Day of the Soldado - accompanied by the debutant co-writer, Will Staples.  \r\n\r\nI can\u2019t consider myself a Jack Ryan \u201cfan\u201d, but I do remember enjoying the first three movies. I don\u2019t possess any knowledge about the story told in the books or John Kelly himself, so I watched this Amazon Studios flick with simple expectations of receiving a decent enough action film. Overall, that\u2019s precisely what I got. The runtime under two hours flies by due to the numerous action sequences, which are obviously the most entertaining element of the entire movie. From the long takes with intense fight choreography to the more steady, suspense-driven situations, Without Remorse doesn\u2019t have extended intervals between each action set piece, which will satisfy viewers solely looking for the more energetic stuff.\r\n\r\nThe stunt work needs to be complimented. The team behind the riveting, loud, exciting action deserves to be addressed since they\u2019re the ones who truly make this type of film popular and successful. With that said, every movie requires the two pillars of filmmaking - story and characters - to be well-built, which is something this film only partially accomplishes. Despite John Kelly holding a tragic, dark backstory and emotionally compelling motivations, his character arc follows the generic development formula viewers have seen previously in other movies of the same genre. Regarding the narrative, it\u2019s really no more than a direct revenge story with an inconsequential, uninteresting socio-economic, political angle, all being easily predictable from the get-go.\r\n\r\nMichael B. Jordan (Creed, Black Panther) delivers a remarkable physical and emotional performance, carrying the whole film on his shoulders. By incorporating his character\u2019s complicated, complex feelings of anger, grief, sadness, and sorrow, Jordan offers a captivating display that holds the viewers\u2019 attention until the very end. Unfortunately, every other actor-character combo is so far away from the efficiency of the protagonist that all are pretty forgettable. From Jamie Bell\u2019s (Rocketman, Snowpiercer) bland interpretation to Jodie Turner-Smith\u2019s (Queen & Slim) forced efforts, the scripts for every secondary character are filled with either exposition or irrelevant pieces of dialogue.\r\n\r\nClearly, this is yet another attempt to revive an action saga, which I don\u2019t think has a place today. From Mission: Impossible to John Wick, passing through Fast & Furious and the superhero universes, a Jack Ryan spin-off might just be interpreted as another random flick instead of serious competition to any of the before-mentioned franchises. Final praises to Philippe Rousselot\u2019s camera work and Matthew Newman\u2019s editing, which contributed to some impressive, entertaining scenes. In the end, that\u2019s all that matters to a massive chunk of the audience.\r\n\r\nWithout Remorse follows a compelling protagonist in a path of revenge through suspenseful, intense action sequences triggered by the usual cliches and storytelling formulas of the genre. Michael B. Jordan is the star of the show, delivering a remarkably captivating performance that helps Stefano Sollima\u2019s movie survive its unsurprising screenplay. Taylor Sheridan and Will Staples focus on building an interesting \u201chero\u201d, but forget to apply that same level of dedication to the narrative and the secondary characters. Overall, it\u2019s a fast-paced, action-driven film that will satisfy most viewers looking for something to watch on the weekend. Exceptional stunt work that must not be forgotten. However, if you desire a more creative, unique take on the Jack Ryan universe, maybe the sequel will do a better job.\r\n\r\nRating: B-", "created_at": "2021-04-28T16:37:04.159Z", "id": "60898f30e19de90057936173", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T16:37:04.159Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60898f30e19de90057936173"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}, {"id": 399566, "page": 1, "results": [{"author": "SWITCH.", "author_details": {"name": "SWITCH.", "username": "maketheSWITCH", "avatar_path": "/klZ9hebmc8biG1RC4WmzNFnciJN.jpg", "rating": 8.0}, "content": "As pure popcorn entertainment and the culmination of the Monsterverse saga, 'Godzilla vs. Kong' delivers the goods in an unexpectedly big way.

Sadly we all know what happened soon after as a two-week lockdown grew and cinemas around the world were closed.\r\n\r\nAs cinemas re-open with growing but limited capacity; the film is set for release and will be a great indicator as to if the public is ready to return to cinemas in significant numbers or will they sit it out and opt to see the film down the line on Paramount+.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a look at the day things changed for the world as Lee (John Krasinski); does some shopping while news reports come in of an explosion in Shanghai. Enjoying the weather; he joins his family at a Little League game and talks with his friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) when the game is interrupted by the appearance of a large fireball in the sky.\r\n\r\nAs they head home; the city falls under attack by deadly creatures and Lee and his family narrowly escape. The film then jumps forward immediately following the conclusion of the first film and Evelyn (Emily Blunt); attempts to lead her newborn son, daughter Regan ( Millicent Simmons), and son Marcus (Noah Jupe) to a safer locale.\r\n\r\nWhen Marcus is injured along the way; Evelyn takes refuge with Emmett who is not happy to have to care for others after the loss of his wife and despite a secure locale in a foundry; demands the family leave the following day.\r\n\r\nWhen an unexpected radio signal appears; Regan is determined to leave and find the source as she knows the frequency of her Cochlear Implant is a weapon against the creatures and she figures if that can be broadcasted and the information revealed; then humanity has a chance to fight back and win.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a very gripping and intense story as Regan and Emmett attempt to complete the mission while Evelyn and her family endure all manner of threats as they try to survive.\r\n\r\nThe film builds upon what made the first film so great in that there are strong and relatable characters and some very tense situations. The screening we attended was so quiet you could tell that audience members were so enthralled that they were afraid to make any noise.\r\n\r\nThe film ups the action and expands upon the universe without losing any of the strong character-driven elements or relying too much upon CGI to carry the film.\r\n\r\nJohn Krasinski writes, directed, and produced the film, and while he has less screen time than he did in the original; the film is the rare sequel that holds its own and actually improves upon the original.\r\n\r\nMy only issue with the film was that the ending was rather abrupt and left me with several unanswered questions.

Hence, you know how much I absolutely love that movie. A low-budget, high-concept horror flick that surprised everyone, including myself, ultimately becoming one of the very best films of the respective year, as well as one of the best original horror stories in the last couple of decades. Now, I acknowledge that John Krasinski created something that could very well turn out to be the \"next big thing\" when it comes to horror franchises. However, that doesn't mean I support that endeavor. Artistically, I would much rather prefer for this to be a one-off, but I know better than anyone that if an original movie is tremendously successful at the box office - especially one that requires a short amount of money to make - sequel talks will obviously emerge.\r\n\r\nMy only major issue with the first film was, in fact, its ending. It's an admittedly badass conclusion, but it also felt like a cry to Hollywood in order to extend the story. I didn't expect this type of ending for such a character-driven personal project, but in all honesty, I rather have a sequel to A Quiet Place than the 10th SAW film or the continuation of the never-ending Fast & Furious saga. With that said, my expectations were still pretty high due to Krasinski's even more impactful involvement in the movie. With sole screenwriting credit and only possessing a few minutes of screentime this time around, Krasinski gets more time to focus on his primary technical role, delivering, once again, a masterfully directed film.\r\n\r\nI find A Quiet Place Part II inferior to its predecessor in many ways, but the extreme levels of suspense generated by Krasinski's flawless direction are still the highlight of this saga. The beautifully shot opening sequence (cinematography by Polly Morgan) sets up the incredibly high level of tension for the subsequent monster scenes, all requiring the viewers to hold their breath for several minutes. These nerve-wracking moments are elevated by terrific acting performances across the board - I'll get there - but Krasinski demonstrates exquisite knowledge of the art of filmmaking, using his best attributes in favor of the movie. Boasting a nail-biting atmosphere and effective jumpscares, the characters find a few imaginative evasion maneuvers to avoid the monsters.\r\n\r\nHowever, this leads me to one of my main issues with this sequel. The first film establishes the creatures in its ruthless, merciless first few minutes, where it becomes clear that if someone makes the tiniest noise and if a monster is nearby, they're dead. There's a minimal chance of survival, and the emotionally resonant ending also attests to this fundamental, lethal aspect of the whole \"sound-hunting beasts\" concept. Nevertheless, during the entire runtime of the sequel, including the phenomenal opening, it's like we're witnessing different monsters. If the first movie already had a couple of logic-related issues, this sequel increases the number of personal nitpicks.\r\n\r\nPeople can run away quite a bit before the creatures get close - so much that I firmly believed the film would go back to the opening sequence to explain how the main characters managed to escape a specific attack. Protagonists survive absurdly improbable situations due to heavy plot armor. Even a couple of character/plot decisions are questionable, to say the least, particularly the trigger that sets up the third act. After the first movie, where everything feels surprisingly grounded and far from nonsensical, jumping to the continuation of the same story and having to disconnect our brain continuously is a bit disappointing, especially since the screenplay remains incredibly focused on the characters.\r\n\r\nAlmost every element in this film feels less emotionally impactful than the original, but it's far from being a massive letdown. In fact, having in mind the competition in the genre, A Quiet Place Part II might even be one of the best horror sequels ever for all I know. Firstly, the actors are absolutely magnificent. Emily Blunt (Evelyn) and Cillian Murphy - who I didn't expect to have that much importance and screentime as he has - bring their experience to a movie where the young actors are the ones who truly shine. Noah Jupe (Marcus) and Millicent Simmonds (Regan) steal the spotlight from the more renowned colleagues, delivering impressive performances that will surely guarantee them several award nominations by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe focus on deeply exploring the characters strengthens the emotional connection with the viewers, making every scene carry a certain gravitas. Ethical dilemmas are beautifully tackled through Murphy's character, Emmett, who creates an unexpected bond with Regan. The latter stands out as a brave, smart, altruist deaf girl who should inspire many people worldwide - it's worth remembering that Simmonds, a real-life deaf girl, brings outstanding authenticity to her role. Just like the original film, most dialogues contain sign language, so the narrative is also developed through visual storytelling. Once again, Krasinski knows perfectly when and how to tell the audience something exclusively through the camera, many times just pure silence, keeping the viewers' attention on the screen at all times.\r\n\r\nThroughout the sequel, there are various visual nods and callbacks to the first flick that I also appreciated quite a lot, such as a certain object on a shelf or a repeated sentence. The ending carries less emotional weight than the original's brutal final minutes, but the entire last act will go down as one of the most impeccably edited conclusions of the year. Michael P. Shawver needs to cross-cut between excruciatingly tense sequences on completely different locations with important characters facing the same level of danger. The action is displayed seamlessly, letting the viewers genuinely enjoy the last moments of the movie without annoyingly choppy editing. Marco Beltrami's score is really gripping during the entirety of these last few scenes.\r\n\r\nA Quiet Place Part II feels less than its predecessor in almost every element, but it's still one of the best sequels of the genre. From the riveting, frenetic opening sequence - much of it shot in long, uncut takes - to one of the most impressively edited endings I've seen in years, John Krasinski maintains an incredibly tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime, something that's becoming a trademark of his directing career. Story-wise, the characters continue to be the main focus of the narrative. Boasting emotional dilemmas and bold character development, the kids have a surprising impact on the overall screenplay. Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt are remarkable, but Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds are astonishing, especially the latter. However, the monsters are depicted in a much less threatening, lethal manner, leading to many questionable plot decisions, as well as absurd survival situations. In addition to this, the world-building lacks significant revelations and creative ideas. Overall, it's a less emotionally resonant film than the original, which doesn't exactly let me down, but I did expect more from this sequel. Still, I highly recommend watching it at the theater. After all, both audience and critics are enjoying this movie tremendously...\r\n\r\nRating: B", "created_at": "2021-06-02T18:03:35.925Z", "id": "60b7c7f7c8a5ac0059e8ed30", "updated_at": "2021-06-02T18:03:35.925Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60b7c7f7c8a5ac0059e8ed30"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 2}, {"id": 813258, "page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 0, "total_results": 0}, {"id": 726684, "page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 0, "total_results": 0}, {"id": 527774, "page": 1, "results": [{"author": "garethmb", "author_details": {"name": "", "username": "garethmb", "avatar_path": "/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3593437cbd05cebe0a4ee753965a8ad1.jpg", "rating": null}, "content": "In a magical land known as Kumandra; Humans and Dragons co-exist in harmony. When a threat in the form of creatures known as Druun arrive and threaten to destroy everything; the Dragons combine their power to defeat them but in doing so all but one of the Dragons remains.\r\n\r\nIn the new Disney animated film \u201cRaya and the Last Dragon\u201d; audiences are introduced to the narrative of the story by Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), who tells that the world has become fractured and she is to blame. A sacred relic that the Dragons used to Defeat the Druun has given her kingdom prosperity but the surrounding kingdoms all named after various parts of a Dragon are envious of their position.\r\n\r\nWhen Raya\u2019s father Chief Benja (Daniel Dae Kim); attempts to unite the other kingdoms, a tragic betrayal results in the relic becoming fractured with each kingdom taking a fragment. As if this situation was not bad enough; the fracturing of the relic ushers in the return of the Druun and they quickly resume turning everything not protected by a barrier of water to stone.\r\n\r\nThe story then jumps years into the future where Raya and her faithful companion Tuk Tuk (Alan TudyK) are searching the rivers of the kingdoms in an effort to find the location where the last Dragon Sisu (Awkwafina) is rumored to have been sleeping for 500 years.\r\n\r\nRaya is eventually able to locate Sisu who is a very playful and animated creature and the two set off to save the day by obtaining the missing fragments through any means necessary. Naturally, their journey will be filled with dangers, adventure, and humor, as the various kingdoms have their own unique visual style and characters; some of whom join with Raya on her quest to provide much-needed support, perspective, and at times; humor.\r\n\r\nThe movie is visually amazing as the artists clearly were inspired to create a world that combines elements of many Asian cultures yet has its own unique traits. I marveled at the details of the water and ripples and how the railings on a boat showed uneven discoloration and wear in just a casual scene where the characters talked. It is this attention to detail that really adds to the magic of the film as well as the immersion into fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast was great and there are some characters I do not wish to spoil who practically steals every scene in which they are in.  My wife and I were captivated from the very start as Disney has created a film that embodies much of their classic themes and yet expands upon them to create a film the entire family will enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe movie will be released in cinemas and via a paid option for Disney+ subscribers. We attended a press screening at a cinema; our first in almost a year and found the setup to be very safe and it was amazing to see such visual splendor on a big screen.\r\n\r\nDisney has once again created a new classic and has given audiences the magic that they are known for at a time when it is most needed.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5.", "created_at": "2021-03-01T17:10:51.977Z", "id": "603d201b33a533004bd1906e", "updated_at": "2021-03-07T15:46:34.342Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/603d201b33a533004bd1906e"}, {"author": "msbreviews", "author_details": {"name": "", "username": "msbreviews", "avatar_path": "/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg", "rating": 7.0}, "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nDisney purchased Pixar way back in 2006, and many incredible animated films have been released under both banners. Therefore, it\u2019s quite understandable that many people don\u2019t recognize the difference between Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar itself. The latter studio released two movies just last year (Onward, Soul), while the former\u2019s latest original film dates back to 2016\u2019s Moana. So, there was a lot of anticipation for a new animated movie from the studio that gave us classics such as Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, and more recently, the Frozen saga. With Don Hall (Big Hero 6) and Carlos L\u00f3pez Estrada (Blindspotting) at the helm, and Adele Lim (Crazy Rich Asians) and Qui Nguyen (feature-film debut) tackling the screenplay, did they succeed in delivering a good film?\r\n\r\nWell, if I must answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, I\u2019ll go with the first one. Let\u2019s start with the positives. The one thing everyone expects from a Disney animated movie is beautiful animation, and Raya and the Last Dragon features tons of gorgeous, creative, jaw-dropping sceneries. The different lands that the story takes the viewers through look impressively realistic, some of them clearly drawing inspiration from real Asian places and culture. The character drawings also look excellent, even though they\u2019re not too far from what we\u2019ve seen from 3D animation in the last few years. \r\n\r\nTechnically though, my standout goes to James Newton Howard\u2019s addictive, chill-inducing score. From the emotional tracks to the riveting tones that elevate every action sequence, it\u2019s a score that I\u2019ll struggle to get out of my head for the next couple of weeks, especially its main theme. In fact, I\u2019m actually listening to it while writing this review, and I\u2019m feeling full of energy. The sound effects for the Druun monsters are pretty eerie, it\u2019s hard not to feel the weight of their threatening presence, but the inspirational, tear-inducing soundtracks leave me floored. The action scenes are wonderfully shot and animated, bringing high levels of entertainment and excitement to a partially adventure-driven narrative. Raya\u2019s sword fighting is indisputably the most captivating type of battle seen throughout the entire runtime.\r\n\r\nStory-wise is where things get a little disappointing, to be completely honest. While the visuals share outstanding imagination and creativity, Adele Lim and Qui Nguyen\u2019s formulaic screenplay is much more straightforward and unsurprising than expected. I knew Raya and the Last Dragon wasn\u2019t going to deliver a groundbreaking narrative, but a videogame-style script is far from being a good alternative. The third act tries to challenge its story\u2019s predictability with one little unexpected moment that I undoubtedly love, but besides not changing the outcome predicted in the first ten minutes of the film, it severely damages a secondary character.\r\n\r\nRegarding this last issue, I can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s my main problem with the movie, but I would have to go into spoiler territory to fully explain it. Therefore, I\u2019ll only address the character\u2019s inconsistency, which unfortunately affects the film\u2019s primary message. The main themes revolve around trust and how if we treat other people kindly, they\u2019ll treat us in the same way. A lovely note that parents will surely want to transmit to their kids, without the shadow of a doubt. However, the character in question spends the movie not knowing where to stand, constantly betraying everyone, and even blaming others for something that same character triggered in the first place.\r\n\r\nDespite having a significantly negative impact on my enjoyment of the film, the ending does work quite well and compensates for my problem with the said character. Kelly Marie Tran lends her voice to Raya, a protagonist easy to root for due to her clear motivations and important mission, while Awkwafina is very funny as Sisu, a goofy dragon with more depth than what the viewers might expect from the first impression. Everyone in the cast delivers extraordinary voice work, and every character has some sort of captivating trait that makes the audience support them, except for you know who. Having in mind that kids are indeed the target audience, I\u2019m positive all will feel delighted with this movie.\r\n\r\nBoasting a predominantly Asian American cast, all delivering exceptional voice work, Raya and the Last Dragon follows a partially disappointing, formulaic narrative but compensates it with stunning animation, a chill-inducing score, and quite a nice ending. Walt Disney Animation Studios returns with an original story that lacks surprising elements, lending all the creativity and imagination to its entertaining, fast-paced adventure packed with undeniably impactful visuals and incredibly riveting action sequences. Despite a significant problem with an inconsistent character that profoundly affects my enjoyment of the film, all other characters are extremely likable, goofy, and well-written. A delightful message about trust and treating others kindly is ultimately well-transmitted to the viewers, which I hope parents will show their kids. Final remark: James Newton Howard\u2019s score will not leave your minds for a long, long time.\r\n\r\nRating: B", "created_at": "2021-03-01T17:13:07.315Z", "id": "603d20a3e267de005151480c", "updated_at": "2021-03-07T15:47:13.254Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/603d20a3e267de005151480c"}, {"author": "SWITCH.", "author_details": {"name": "SWITCH.", "username": "maketheSWITCH", "avatar_path": "/klZ9hebmc8biG1RC4WmzNFnciJN.jpg", "rating": 7.0}, "content": "'Raya and the Last Dragon' is a solid step back in the right direction for Walt Disney Animation Studios. Over the past 20 years, they've struggled to find their confidence and voice as a studio, certainly due to complicated changes of leadership and the rise of genuine artistic and financial competitors, but 'Raya' is the kind of film in which they do their best work - an entertaining and exciting experience built on a strong protagonist with a clear motivation and a powerful internal conflict. The legacy of Disney animation has been to speak to the deep emotional truths of the human experience in a way that is accessible to anyone, and with its themes of self-belief, moving through grief and trauma, and finding the trust in others and ourselves, 'Raya and the Last Dragon' is a worthy part of that legacy.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-raya-and-the-last-dragon-a-solid-return-to-form-for-walt-disney-animation-studios", "created_at": "2021-03-08T02:20:27.149Z", "id": "604589ebca0e17007648b76b", "updated_at": "2021-03-08T02:20:27.149Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/604589ebca0e17007648b76b"}, {"author": "Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots", "author_details": {"name": "Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots", "username": "screenzealots", "avatar_path": "/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/70d4177132896d293b72f4c595521141.jpg", "rating": 8.0}, "content": "It\u2019s terrific to see the animated movies continuing to evolve, and \u201cRaya and the Last Dragon\u201d is the latest film that takes the traditional idea of a Disney heroine and makes a huge leap into a welcome new direction. This magical fantasy / adventure tale features inspired characters, beautiful animation, and a culturally accurate representation of Asian mythology. It\u2019s a terrific movie on all levels.\r\n\r\nLong ago in the make-believe world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. There was a complete balance to the world until an evil force known as the Druun began to threaten the land. This sinister tribe of shadow monsters rose to power by feeding off the discord of humans, and the dragons decided to sacrifice themselves to save all of humanity. New unrest nearly 500 years later has resulted in the five divided lands of the kingdom refusing to co-exist in peace, giving rise to the Druun once again. Determined to preserve the world she loves, lone warrior Raya (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran) decides to track down the last living dragon and use its magic to save Kumandra.\r\n\r\nRaya is a trailblazing heroine, and she\u2019s one that\u2019s easy to admire and love. Her determination never falters as she learns the value of teamwork and trust along her journey. The film\u2019s main characters are all female, from the last dragon Sisu (voiced by Awkwafina) to Raya\u2019s adversary Namaari (voiced by Gemma Chan). There\u2019s a magical relationship between Sisu and Raya, two unlikely friends that discover in each other that exactly little spark that each of their lives were missing. Even better, Raya collects a group of misfits along her journey, reinforcing the idea that heroes can come from the most unlikely places.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s group of directors (Don Hall, Carlos L\u00f3pez Estrada, Paul Briggs, and John Ripa) has created original characters that are unlike others you\u2019ve seen before, and the beautiful animation brings them to life. Sisu is a gorgeous pastel-hued dragon with a personality to match (Awkwafina is the MVP in the cast). Raya is a new kind of Disney \u201cprincess,\u201d one who knows how to take charge and can kick butt. There\u2019s so much for everyone to love here, even if some of the goofier gags (like a thieving baby who is far more irritating than cute) may take viewers out of the overall experience.\r\n\r\nThe story is exciting and the elements of mythical adventure are spirited, making \u201cRaya and the Last Dragon\u201d one of the more interesting films to come out of Disney in a while. It\u2019s an animated feature with a positive, sincere message, lively action scenes, and a sweet tale of friendship that can be enjoyed by the entire family.", "created_at": "2021-03-09T15:44:16.569Z", "id": "604797d0ea37e00045400a6b", "updated_at": "2021-03-09T15:44:16.569Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/604797d0ea37e00045400a6b"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 4}, {"id": 586047, "page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 0, "total_results": 0}]
