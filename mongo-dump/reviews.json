I was very young but little did I know that movie would change my life and put me on the path that I am now. Over the decades that have followed I have read the books and comics, played with the toys, played the video games, and eagerly watched any new film or television show related to the franchise.\n\nThe fact that Disney has put out a new film every years since \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d is great for fans like me as those three year waits; to say nothing of the 17+ years between the Original and Prequel Trilogies were tough.\n\nThrough it all my favorite character has always been Han Solo. I do not know what it is but the brash, cocky, money loving; scoundrel who gets in and out of trouble yet does the right thing in the end has always connected with me.\nSo when news came that there would be a new movie based on the early years of the title characters I was excited but concerned as Harrison Ford is so iconic in that role I could not see how anyone could measure up.\n\nCombine that with original Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller being removed from the film after shooting a significant number of weeks, there was ample concern to go around.\n\nFortunately for fans, Director Ron Howard has crafted a very enjoyable film as \u201cHan Solo: A Star Wars Story\u201d deftly combines the action, visuals, and humor that made the films cinematic legends and in doing so introduces new characters and expands the lore of the Star Wars Universe.\n\nThe film follows a young Han (Alden Ehrenreich), who hustles to survive and get off the world of Corrilia.\n\nHan like many kids on the street pull all sorts of scams under the control of various criminals and he plots to escape with his friend Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke).\nWhen an opportunity arises, Han takes it, but finds himself in the Imperial Navy which does not bode well for a person with strong opinions and a mind of his own. \nFate steps in once again and introduces Han to Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and a mentor figure in the form of a man named Beckett (Woody Harrelson).   Han attempts to prove himself to his new crew as he sees this as his way out to a better life. However with things take a turn for the worse, he must work with his new associates to clear the slate with a deadly crime boss named Dry\u2019den Vos (Paul Bettany).  \nAs anyone who follows the series knows Han has a way of escalating a situation and this leads the crew to recruiting Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover), into the crew as they set off to pull off a risky and dangerous mission to get the much needed resources to save their lives.\n\nWhat follows is a very enjoyable film that has an appropriate amount of humor and character building as well as plenty of good action and effects which should keep fans of the series happy. The new characters were very enjoyable and added a new depth to Han as well as the Star Wars mythos but what really impressed me was that at no time did I find myself comparing Ehrenreich to Harrison Ford. He was charismatic and enjoyable in the role and I easily believed that this was Han before life, the universe, and circumstances turned him into the man we would know years later.\nGlover is uncanny with his version of Lando and he at times almost sounded like Billy Dee Williams and had many of the mannerisms of the character down His back and forth with Han was great to see and we got a much deeper understand of both the characters and their complicated history with one another.\n\nClark and Harrelson round things out well as they provide a great balance to Han. One is a mentor and one is the link to the life he had and the dreams he wants to achieve.   Ron Howard moves things along well without rushing things as while it does take a bit of time getting up to speed, it happens at a natural pace without seeming rushed. Howard also does not rely on an abundance of effects to carry the film. There are plenty of practical FX and makeup creations to make you well aware that this is a vast and diverse galaxy but he uses them and the CGI to enhance the story rather than carry it.\n\nThere are numerous nods throughout to past films as well both visual and verbal and a few great surprises along the way. It is believed that more adventures of the younger Han will be coming in the future and I cannot wait for them to arrive as this was a very fun film. Now the only hard part will be the 19 month wait for Episode IX as the five month wait from the last film already seems like ages ago and I cannot wait for more.\n\n4.5 stars out of 5", "id": "5afc39c9c3a36807270066ad", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5afc39c9c3a36807270066ad"}, {"author": "jmquint00", "content": "Not a bad movie, but you cannot replace H.

I'd heard virtually nothing good about it so my anxious brain kicked into overdrive the whole time the film was going on. As a result of that, I almost feel like I experienced three movies in that theatre. First, obviously the movie on the screen. Secondly, the awesome movie I was theorising could unfurl at the result of each new sequence and plot point, but that sadly never did. And thirdly, the inexcusably awful and franchise-ruining movie that I feared it was about to take a hard left turn into at any minute, and thankfully never did.\r\n\r\nAnd that's really my experience on _The Predator_ overall, and the reason for a stalemate \"2.5 outta 5\" review: It wasn't as good as it should have been, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. Unfortunately, when the movie I'm writing in my head alongside watching it is better than what's actually on screen, when you take into account that I'm an unimaginative, talentless hack, really doesn't cut it for a sequel to _Predator_, one of of only five movies I've ever given a perfect rating to.\r\n\r\nThe best parts of _The Predator_ are when there is an eponymous Predator on screen. So you might think, \"Oh it's not a good movie, but it's a good _Predator_ movie\", and fair enough a conclusion to draw, but no. Part of the problem is, this movie really could have been pulled off with any aliens at all. Take out the Yautja and replace them with... I dunno, the blue skinned pogo-stick people of Planet Hurfadump, and it can still play out functionally the same. See, although I enjoyed watching the Predators do their thing, there was really nothing beyond cosmetic similarities that made them the Predators we've seen in every movie preceding this one.\r\n\r\nI think possibly part of the reason for that is that every other movie with a Predator in it has been an Action Horror movie (albeit Action Horror with ever-increasing Sci-Fi elements from film to film) whereas _The Predator_ is an Action Comedy, just one with some gore. Now I don't think that taking it that route was necessarily and... abysmal failure, let's say, but was Action Comedy the **best** way to take the _Predator_ franchise? I think it's pretty clear that the answer is no.\r\n\r\nIronic that that direction is being taken by Shane Black, the man who has a history with _Predator_ purely because the crew of the first film were determined to have him to work on the script, which he refused. Now here we are more 30 years later and Shane Black finally **has** put his name on a Predator movie, and it's not even good.\r\n\r\nFuck.

The rest of the cast members are decidedly peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy.

Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure.

Marvel seems to break its villain curse with Klau and especially Killmonger. Killmonger is very well developed and even sympathetic at times, despite his villainy.

I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.\r\n\r\nI actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less\u2026well\u2026stupid!\r\n\r\nPersonally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.\r\n\r\nOn the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less.

There was so much going on; immigration concerns; the fight between saving the world and protecting your own country(sound familiar); the fear of an African country\u2019s resources being pillaged; how best to handle the problems black people face worldwide; and many great authentic feeling cultural nods.  All this while not being heavy or preachy.  You can definitely eat popcorn to this.  The villain; Killmonger, is great.  Not great in that he is scary, though he is, but because he is more complex than some shadowy figure you should just trust is a bad guy because of visual effects or dramatic music.  \r\n\r\nThis movie isn\u2019t just explosions and one-liners in an exotic location.  This is a great movie in general.  It\u2019s always interesting.  There are great relationships between all the characters.  Finally; Wakanda is really a place.  It feels alive and lived in; not just impressive buildings used as a backdrop.  They did a wonderful job of worldbuilding; from the rituals, to the clothing, fancy tech, and scenery.  This movie is definitely worth a watch. \r\n\r\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606-1/2\r\n\r\nI also have to add that; you get to actually see Andy Serkis!

First, the good.\r\n\r\nThe action is fun, the emotions hit home, and the story isn't dirt-poor. \r\n\r\nWhile the CGI gets ripped on from time to time, I thought it was solid enough for a Marvel movie. The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one. It was reminiscent of a James Bond movie. \r\n\r\nIn fact, that's another appeal, at least to me. The secret technology base and the fun action scenes were a great callback to James Bond-type movies. I do think the movie would have been complemented by giving T'Challa a similar vice as Bond's, although Marvel probably wouldn't veer down that line for the seemingly morally absolute King of Wakanda.\r\n\r\nThe story, well, it's a mixed bag. Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie. \r\n\r\nThis is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one. Wakanda has a ton of wonderful mythology, but almost none of it is explained. The movie never really explains how the Wakandans used vibranium was used to make themselves wealthy. It touches on it in some exposition, but there was much more that was just glossed over. \r\n\r\nIn addition, W'Kabi became radicalized by Killmonger much too quickly for such a pivotal relationship to flip. Some of the emotional aspects of the movie fell flat because they weren't given enough screen time. \r\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Black Panther is a fun movie that adds to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The kingdom is technologically advanced due to its secret resource Vibranium, a priceless, almost magical metal. Unfortunately, T\u2019Challa\u2019s reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d (Michael B. Jordan).\r\n\r\nWith its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called \u201cracist\u201d by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie\u2019s likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn\u2019t all that involving. It\u2019s basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even \u201cAnt-Man\u201d (2015).\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there\u2019s some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a \u201ccolonizer,\u201d which isn\u2019t even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.\r\n\r\nThe waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic\u2019s story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the \"Panther's Rage\" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. \r\n\r\nAnd it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T\u2019Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It\u2019s a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W\u2019Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn\u2019t acknowledged in this movie; shameful.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguaz\u00fa Waterfalls, Argentina. Ironically, nothing was shot in Africa.

Perhaps it has to do with the 56-year-old Tom Cruise who defies age and pushes his physical boundaries for our viewing pleasure? The answer is quite evident in \u2018Fallout\u2019 as his Ethan Hunt is as good as a caped superhero in the sixth film of the series. The story isn't all that new with its twists and turns. But \u2018Fallout\u2019 manages to build on the previous films in the series by bringing back old friends and foes, besides adding some new ones. Henry Cavill as August Walker fits right into this universe as the hammer to the scalpel that is Ethan Hunt. His presence is looming enough to fill the entire screen whenever he appears. Simon Pegg takes on the status of a series regular alongside Ving Rhames, whose Benji and Luther respectively play more than just mere sidekicks as they add comic levity and heart. Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett also make a mark in their brief appearances but watch out for impactful turns by Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan along the way.\r\n\r\nWriter & Director Christopher McQuarrie allows each character to shine while building on their history with each other, thus making them endearing to the audience. This only serves to up the ante when they\u2019re in danger. McQuarrie also lets the story breathe by bringing some calm before the storm hits. Which leads to the most crucial aspect of the series, and one that McQuarrie clearly excels at in this film \u2013 the action sequences. Not only are they meticulously planned; they are executed with precision, even when the fist fights are gritty and gruesome. Rob Hardy beautifully choreographs the camerawork following these intricate set-pieces, either allowing you to take in the expanse or bringing you up close and personal when required. This is paired with a soundtrack by Lorne Balfe that lends to the tension by giving the iconic \u2018Mission Impossible\u2019 theme a sinister sense of urgency.\r\n\r\nMcQuarrie has now directed two \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 films; his understanding of the franchise and its characters proves to be the secret weapon of the series. The fact that the stunts are largely done with practical effects featuring the cast, and most prominently Cruise himself, sets a whole new standard for action films. \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u2019 is a great mix of plot, pacing and performances that is undeniably the best entry in the franchise, while it re-establishes Cruise\u2019s status as an action superstar.\r\n\r\nReview by Times of India (TOI)\r\nFinal Rating - 4.0/5", "id": "5b5b3d24c3a368670c015b12", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b5b3d24c3a368670c015b12"}, {"author": "DanDare", "content": "Mission Impossible - Fallout is a continuation of Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation.

It is an action-adventure-comedy plain and simple. If you approach it as such it works reasonably well.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of special effects, they are generally well done. The designs are interesting. The shape of the bad guys spaceship is totally ludicrous of course but visually pleasing and goes with the rest of the movie\u2019s tendency to be more of a comedy than a serious movie.

I watched it again and still wasn\u2019t sure, but now that it\u2019s six months later, I am sure.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a massive fan of director James Gunn.

Not to mention I\u2019m an absolute sucker for the MCU. So after hearing that a very decent chunk of the fanbase thinking that not only was this the best Marvel film of the year (going up against _Winter Soldier_ and _Days of Future Past_), but that they would then go on to say it was the best Marvel Cinematic Universe film ever, you could imagine I was very surprised to find that I actually didn\u2019t think it was all that great.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want people thinking I didn\u2019t like it.

But I didn\u2019t get the magic that everyone was telling me about. How this was the film for the new generation.  I didn\u2019t even get the sense of satisfaction that I had in Cap\u2019s movie just a few months previous.\r\n\r\nSo many things seemed under utilised, but I don\u2019t know what you could have cut to make room for the extra things I wanted. Which means the only way to get it is to have a longer film. It\u2019s already two hours, and a longer movie means a bigger budget and less screenings. ie. more money going out and less money coming in. And at the end of the day Disney is a business, and they have to make their money the best way they think they can. So I understand why it wasn\u2019t perfect for me, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from feeling _Guardians_ is a mite overrated. Good damn movie. But overrated.\r\n\r\nPersonally I\u2019d stick it somewhere in the middle of the MCU\u2019s releases thus far. Leaps and bounds above _The Incredible Hulk_, _The Dark World_ and _Iron Man 2_, but not so beloved as the likes of _The Avengers_, _Winter Soldier_ or _Iron Man 1_.\r\n\r\n73%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_", "id": "5b1676510e0a262de801570b", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b1676510e0a262de801570b"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 8}, {"id": 177677, "page": 1, "results": [{"author": "leros", "content": "good!", "id": "55da46c8c3a36831f6005a5e", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/55da46c8c3a36831f6005a5e"}, {"author": "Frank Ochieng", "content": "Some over-stuffed blockbuster actioners boldly boast their explosive and invigorating productions with dynamic glee. Well, the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 film franchise echoes this same sentiment, with flashy fifty-something star Tom Cruise still carrying that boyish exuberance that never seems to miss a beat, and can breathe a sigh of relief because the latest chapter will not disappoint in its adventurous, adrenaline-rushing skin. Yes, Cruise is back as IMF super spy stud Ethan Hunt in writer-director Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s power-surging \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019. Notoriously slick, ambitious, wildly impish and vastly intriguing, \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 incorporates superb direction, writing and, of course, its no-nonsense dosage of non-stop shenanigans to fuel the audience\u2019s escapist palates.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 is a hyper and hip throwback to the original blueprint for this kinetic movie series that took viewers by storm when it first premiered back in 1996. The minor outcry for the box office sensation that was the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 big screen offering back in the late 90s was quite understandable since it did not seem to stay entirely true to the iconic 60s television series thus being dismissed as a volt-driven vanity piece for the high-strutting Cruise. Still, the cinematic \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 experience did not peter out but steadily built a devoted fan base that wanted to endure the high-flying hedonism of Cruise\u2019s espionage daredevil Hunt and his band of cunning cohorts. It is definitely safe to say that the stellar \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019 has delivered a bang for its buck in a summertime cinema hunger that thrives for such sleek, innovative spy thrillers that charm more than harm. Maybe \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 will not let anyone forget the exploits of the legendary James Bond spy capers anytime soon but hey\u2026Cruise\u2019s hotshot Hunt has a colorfully distinctive way of promoting his \u2018shaken, not stirred\u2019 moments as well.\r\n\r\nSo how did the collaboration of filmmaker McQuarrie and his chance-taking lead Cruise give \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 its deliciously sinister, overactive pulse? The fact that the overzealous stuntwork (much of it performed by Cruise with daring enthusiasm) is imaginative and the story feels smart and clever certainly has a lot to do with the magnetic appeal of \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019. Hey, the TV advertisements even give a generous peek into the pulsating platitudes that the MI universe will swallow with robust anticipation. Watch IMF agent Hunt hang on to a speedy airplane with his dear life in the balance. Watch IMF agent Hunt jump into a deadly spiral of a waterfall. Watch IMF agent Hunt race a piercingly fast motorcycle (or car\u2026take your pick) and enjoy the road raging carnage with poetic prominence. Okay\u2026you get the picture.\r\n\r\nThe premise in \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019 has more bounce to it than a basketball during the NBA playoffs and that is not necessarily a bad thing to note. While Hunt continues his mission to stop the team\u2019s latest despicable foe (Sean Harris) and end the operation of the insidious operation known as the Syndicate there are feathers being ruffled because of the federalised threats to shut down the IMF empire through the suggestion of a top-notch CIA director (Alec Baldwin). Naturally, IMF head honcho Brandt (Jeremy Renner) tries to prevent such hasty actions as his team of agents must overcome some of the controversy and confrontations from previous disastrous events that have warranted the threatening hints to shutdown his governmental outfit.\r\n\r\nCruise's Agent Ethan Hunt is leaving on a jet plane and doesn't know how long he'll be back again in the eye-popping actioner MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-ROGUE NATION.\r\nCruise\u2019s Agent Ethan Hunt is leaving on a jet plane and doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll be back again in the eye-popping actioner MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-ROGUE NATION.\r\nOne cannot say enough about the ponderous yet action-packed \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 as this exceedingly spry and hyperactive spy caper keeps one on their anxious feet while never letting up for a gasp of air. The exotic locales, showy opera houses, heart-pounding action sequences, innovative chase scenes on wheels, over-the-top baddies, well-choreographed fist fights and, of course, Cruise\u2019s roguish Hunt and his willingness to soak up the mischievousness and mayhem of the proceedings allows this particular \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 installment to resonate so soundly in its off-kilter, energetic greatness. The supporting players such as Simon Pegg\u2019s Benji and Ving Rhames\u2019s Luther are on hand to contribute to the landscape of the triumphant cloak-and-dagger goings-on. In particular, Rebecca Ferguson is the transfixing tart whose presence as Cruise\u2019s enigmatic female lead is easily a scene stealer. Can she be trusted or not? Who cares? In the long run, Ferguson\u2019s inclusion is almost mandatory just to spice up this first-rate popcorn pleaser a tad bit more. Tom Hollander (\u2018In the Loop\u2019) adds some flavor in the mix as the unpredictable British Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nMcQuarrie (who worked with Cruise previously on \u2018Jack Reacher\u2019 and helmed \u2018The Way Of The Gun\u2019) had a tough act to follow in terms of trying to keep stride with prior \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 big names in auteurs Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird. Indeed, that is a tall order to fill. However, as the Oscar-winner screenwriter for \u2018The Usual Suspects\u2019 McQuarrie has shown that his take on the fifth edition of the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 film franchise with \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 can easily be as defiant and defining as any of his predecessors\u2019 intense, eye-popping outings.\r\n\r\n\u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019, with its lavish set pieces and sophisticated sense of winding and grinding with the twitchy antics of Cruise leading the pack, is perhaps the closest thing to resembling the elegance and excellence of the indomitable Agent 007.\r\n\r\nMission: Impossible-Rogue Nation (2015)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 12 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Rebecca Ferguson, Tom Hollander, Simon McBurney and Zang Jingchu\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: Christopher McQuarrie\r\n\r\nRating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Spy Thriller/Action-Adventure/Intrigue and Espionage\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)", "id": "56207f7092514171d4006ad6", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/56207f7092514171d4006ad6"}, {"author": "Andres Gomez", "content": "Everything you can expect from a \"Mission: Impossible\" movie.

That being said, how many film franchises can say that their fifth instalment was also their best? Probably just this one, and, maybe _Fast & Furious_. There\u2019s actually a lot of parallels between those two lines of movies. \r\n\r\nPertaining specifically to _Mission: Impossible_ though, this one truly is the best of the bunch in my opinion. It has it\u2019s most complete female role to date, in fact, you could say that of any character. This is the first film that doesn\u2019t feel like it entirely hinges on Ethan Hunt\u2019s input. The characters surrounding him are actual people with their own personalities and ideas. And maybe it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve watched him do it five times in the past three days, but honestly I even sort of bought Tom Cruise in an action role this time around. \r\n\r\nCrazy.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._", "id": "57b40f23c3a368184a001bd9", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/57b40f23c3a368184a001bd9"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 4}]
